### We can host our static webpages free for lifetime
With the increasing popularity of static site generators, a lot of services have come up allowing you to host static website for free.

You can choose from many top static site generators, such as 11ty and Hugo when building your own static site. Or you can code up easily build a static website with HTML and CSS using a pre-built template. 
For example my blog is built with a gatsby temaplate and hosted for free.

#### 1. Github pages
GitHub allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository and lets you map them to custom domains. Since having public repositories on GitHub is free, you get to have free static website hosting using GitHub pages. 
All you need to do is to change your respoitory name to your_username.gtihub.io

#### 2. Netlify

Netlify is one of the best options for hosting static websites for free.
Netlify offers an impressive bunch of features which are useful for hosting not just static websites but single-page apps and advanced commercial web projects. Their free plan gives you all the goodness offered by GitHub pages along with added advantages such as a CI system which can be used with private repositories, custom domain which supports free SSL and free CDN out of the box, custom redirect rules as well as hooks and notifications.
 Even my blog is hosted in netlify, it's just super easy to use and gives free ssl support. With the rise of JAM Stack the netlify is taking the static sites to a whole new level (have a search about JAM Stack in google).
